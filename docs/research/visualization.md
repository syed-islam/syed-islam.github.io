ApiNATOMY is an open source graphical toolkit for interactive knowledge management developed as part of the [Open Physiology](http://open-physiology.org/) effort. Within ApiNATOMY, knowledge is visualized in the form of circuitboard schematics, via a platform-independent 4D (i.e. 3D + time) JavaScript environment. While the toolkit per se is generic, our driving use case is the management of knowledge about (i) multiscale anatomy in general, and (ii) routes of physiology communication in particular. A key goal of our effort is to support the open biomedical community to collaborate, share and interact with complex data and models in genomics, physiology, pharmacology and pathology.
